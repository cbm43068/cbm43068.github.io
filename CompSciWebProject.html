    <h4><u><b>Human Impact</b></u></h4>
    <P> Unfortunatley, mankind has had a severe impact on the world's bear species. Today, one species is endangered and a number more are listed as "threatened."
      The Panda Bear is the most endangered species with only 1,600 remaining. In addition, Polar bear population numbers are dramatically falling due to the quick reduction in sea life due to climate change.
      However, all bear species are being impacted by human activities thats leading to fall population numbers worldwide. Some of the factors include:
